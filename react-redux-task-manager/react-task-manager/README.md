## 🧠 Challenges Faced

While building this project, I faced several practical challenges that helped me improve my React development skills:


### 1. State Management

Managing tasks across multiple components became challenging as the application grew.

To solve this, I used Redux Toolkit to create a centralized and predictable state management structure, making task updates easier to handle and maintain.


### 2. Data Persistence

Initially, tasks were stored only in the application state, which caused data loss after refreshing the browser.

I implemented LocalStorage synchronization to save tasks automatically and restore them when the application loads, providing a better user experience.


### 3. Responsive Sidebar & User Experience

One of the main challenges was creating a navigation experience that works properly across different devices.

Instead of simply shrinking the desktop sidebar on smaller screens, I changed the interaction pattern for mobile devices by converting it into a collapsible sidebar.

The goal was not only to make the layout responsive, but to provide a better UX by:

- Saving screen space on mobile
- Allowing users to open and close navigation when needed
- Maintaining comfortable spacing and positioning
- Creating smooth transitions between layouts


### 4. Component Organization

As features increased, keeping the code clean and maintainable became important.

I separated the application into reusable components with clear responsibilities to make future updates easier.



### 5. Debugging Layout Issues

During development, I faced several UI challenges related to spacing, responsive behavior, and component positioning.

I used browser developer tools and continuous testing on different screen sizes to identify and solve these issues.



## 🔮 Future Improvements

Possible improvements for future versions:

- Connect the application with a backend API instead of LocalStorage
- Add user authentication
- Add task deadlines and reminders
- Add calendar integration
- Implement drag and drop task ordering
- Add task categories and labels
- Add dark/light mode
- Improve accessibility support
- Add automated testing
- Optimize performance for larger task lists
